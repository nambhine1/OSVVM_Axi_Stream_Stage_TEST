# axi_stream_stage

This project demonstrates how to use **OSVVM** (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology) to verify a simple AXI4-Stream pipeline stage. The design features a basic AXI4-Stream interface with standard VALID/READY handshaking and single-beat buffering.

The purpose of this project is to show how OSVVM can be applied to verify the functional behavior of the `axi_stream_stage` module. It provides an example of stimulus generation, functional checking.
